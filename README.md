# NewsLabs instructions
To see the output, go to the textfiles "questiononeGC.txt" and "QuestionTwo.csv".

You can see the output of each part of the programs within the "QuestionOneGC.ipynb" and "QuestionTwoGC.ipynb" GitHub files.

If you want to run the code yourself:

* Log in to Google.
* Press the orange colab button on the "QuestionOneGC.ipynb" or "QuestionTwoGC.ipynb" GitHub files.
* In the menu option "Runtime" choose "Run all".
* Press the "Choose files" button when prompted.
* Upload "Article-Devices.csv".
  * If you do not have this already, I have also uploaded this to Github.
* To find the output, select the folder icon on the left-hand vertical bar.
